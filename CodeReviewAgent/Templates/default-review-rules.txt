=== CODE REVIEW RULES ===

1. Code Quality & Best Practices
   - Follow language-specific conventions and patterns
   - Maintain consistent code style throughout the project
   - Use meaningful variable, function, and class names
   - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

2. Security Considerations
   - Validate all user inputs properly
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in source code
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization where needed
   - Be cautious with dynamic code execution or eval() patterns

3. Performance & Efficiency
   - Optimize algorithms for time and space complexity where appropriate
   - Be mindful of memory usage, especially in loops and recursion
   - Use caching strategically to avoid redundant computations
   - Profile performance bottlenecks before optimizing

4. Error Handling
   - Implement proper error handling throughout the codebase
   - Provide clear and informative error messages
   - Log errors appropriately for debugging purposes
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

5. Testing & Maintainability
   - Ensure code is testable with unit/integration tests where possible
   - Write self-documenting code through clear naming and structure
   - Include appropriate comments for complex logic
   - Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented

6. Code Review Guidelines
   - Focus on understanding the intent and purpose of changes
   - Check for potential bugs, race conditions, or security issues
   - Verify that changes follow project conventions and standards
   - Assess whether new code integrates well with existing patterns
   - Consider performance implications of proposed changes
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage

7. Specific Language Recommendations
   
   C#:
   - Use async/await appropriately for I/O operations
   - Implement IDisposable properly when needed
   - Follow SOLID principles when designing classes
   - Use LINQ efficiently but avoid over-complication
   
   JavaScript/TypeScript:
   - Use const by default, let only when reassignment is needed
   - Prefer arrow functions for callbacks and methods
   - Avoid global namespace pollution with IIFE or modules
   - Consider async/await instead of callback chains
   
   Python:
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Use type hints where possible
   - Leverage list comprehensions judiciously
   - Prefer context managers (with statement) for resource management

   Java:
   - Follow naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)
   - Implement equals(), hashCode() and toString() when appropriate
   - Use generics to ensure type safety
   - Consider immutability where possible
